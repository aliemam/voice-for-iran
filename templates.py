## Current Situation in Iran (Updated Context - January 2026)

The Iranian clerical regime has imposed a total internet blackout and begun widespread killings of civilians. VERIFIED FACTS:

- **12,000+ civilians killed** since the internet blackout began (reported by sources inside Iran)
- Complete internet shutdown for over 98 hours, cutting 90 million people from the world
- Security forces shooting protesters in the streets, including women and children
- Mass arrests of activists, journalists, students, and ordinary citizens
- Hospitals overwhelmed, families cannot find their loved ones
- The regime is hiding a massacre from the world

## Key Hashtags
IMPORTANT: Always include #IranProtests in every message. Pick 1 other:
- #IranProtests - REQUIRED in every message
- #FreeIran - Call for freedom
- #BeOurVoice - Call for international support
- #جاویدشاه - Long live the king (Persian)
- #KingRezaPahlavi - Support for Reza Pahlavi

## Tone Guidelines
- Urgent but not alarmist
- Factual and credible - cite the death toll
- Respectful to the recipient
- Personal and authentic (not robotic or templated)
- Call to action when appropriate

## What We're Asking (PERSONALIZE based on who they are)
- **Journalists**: Cover the story, investigate, send reporters, expose the massacre
- **Politicians**: Speak out publicly, impose sanctions, diplomatic pressure, support free internet
- **Celebrities**: Use your massive platform to raise awareness, share stories
- **Tech Leaders**: Help restore internet access (Starlink), provide communication tools

You are writing to a US Senator who is a close ally of President Donald Trump. President Trump has publicly promised to support the Iranian people in their fight for freedom.

## The Core Message (adapt this, don't copy verbatim)
"Senator, with respect, please urge Donald Trump to stand by his promise to support the Iranian people. The clerical regime has shut down the internet and has begun widespread killings of civilians. We urgently need international pressure, protection of lives, and support for free internet access. Thank you."

## Critical Instructions
- Be EXTREMELY polite and respectful - use "Senator" as address
- Appeal to Trump's promise to support Iranian people
- Reference the internet shutdown and civilian killings (12,000+ dead)
- Ask for: international pressure, protection of lives, free internet access

- Keep the formal, respectful tone throughout
- This is a plea for help, not a demand

## What Makes This Different
- These senators have direct influence on Trump administration policy

## Context: Finland Emergency - Release of Arrested Iranian Protesters

Two Iranian citizens have been arrested by Finnish police after they removed the Islamic Republic flag from the Iranian embassy in Helsinki.

## Base Template (use this as reference, but vary the wording each time):
```
Hyvä vastaanottaja,
Kirjoitan teille koskien kahta henkilöä, jotka poliisi otti kiinni Iranin suurlähetystön pihalla Helsingissä tapahtuneen lipputangon kaatamiseen ja aidan töhrimiseen liittyen. Uutisten mukaan heitä epäillään törkeästä julkisrauhan rikkomisesta ja vahingonteosta.
Kansainvälisessä mediassa ja ihmisoikeusjärjestöjen raporteissa on parhaillaan laajaa huolta Iranin sisäisistä protesteista, niihin liittyvästä väkivallasta ja yli kymmenentuhannen mielenosoittajan pidätyksistä sekä suurista kuolonuhrimääristä, kun mielenosoittajat vaativat poliittisia ja sosiaalisia oikeuksia sekä hallinnon uudistuksia. Näitä protesteja on kuvattu laajaksi, rauhanomaiseksi, mutta myös voimakkaasti tukevaksi iranilaisten omille vaatimuksille paremmista oikeuksista ja vapaudesta.
On tärkeää, että perustuslaillisia oikeuksia ja oikeasuhtaisuutta sovelletaan myös Suomessa, kun arvioidaan tekoja, jotka on tehty osana poliittista ilmaisua tai solidaarisuutta laajempia ihmisoikeuksien vaatimuksia kohtaan. Pyydän teitä harkitsemaan uudelleen heidän tapauksen käsittelyä ja pidätettyjen vapauttamista tai vaihtoehtoisesti vapauttavia toimenpiteitä, mikäli heidän vapaudenmenetykselleen ei ole selkeää ja oikeasuhtaista lakiperustetta.
Arvostan suuresti poliisin työtä yleisen järjestyksen ylläpitämiseksi, mutta korostan, että oikeudenmukaisuus ja ilmaisunvapauden turvaaminen ovat keskeisiä perusoikeuksia, joiden kunnioittaminen on tärkeää myös tällaisissa poliittisesti latautuneissa tilanteissa.
Kiitos ajastanne ja huomiostanne.

A person was arrested in connection with an incident at the Islamic Republic's embassy in Denmark.

```
To Copenhagen Police / The relevant police authorities,

I hereby submit a formal request for reconsideration of the detention of the person who was arrested in connection with the incident at the Islamic Republic's embassy in Denmark.

It should be clarified that – according to available information – no physical harm to any persons occurred in connection with the incident. The person's behavior consisted primarily of verbal aggression, which should be considered an expression of accumulated emotional burden and strong anger in a political and protest context.

It is also acknowledged that property damage occurred, which naturally is a matter that must be handled in accordance with applicable Danish law. Despite this, it is requested that the principle of proportionality as well as the specific situation and the person's mental and emotional state at the time of the incident be given significant weight in the further assessment.

On this basis, it is respectfully requested that the police consider release, possibly with alternative or milder measures, instead of continued detention, until the case may be finally decided.
```

# Yle Correction Email Template

## Context: Yle Article Correction Request

A Yle article about Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei states that he is "not a dictator" ("Khamenei ei ole kuitenkaan diktaattori").

This framing is misleading because the Supreme Leader:
- Has unchecked authority over Iran's military, judiciary, state media, and key political institutions
- Directly or indirectly controls bodies that vet election candidates
- Is not accountable to the public through any democratic mechanism
- Is above public criticism (criticizing him can result in arrest and long prison sentences)
- Cannot be removed by the people

While Iran formally has a president and parliament, these institutions operate within strict limits imposed by unelected authorities loyal to the Supreme Leader.

## Base Template (use as reference, vary the wording each time):
```
Hyvä vastaanottaja,

Kirjoitan koskien Ylen artikkelia, jossa käsitellään Iranin hengellistä johtajaa Ali Khameneita ja todetaan, ettei häntä voida pitää diktaattorina.

Haluan kunnioittavasti tuoda esiin, että tämä sanamuoto on harhaanjohtava. Käytännössä Iranin hengellisellä johtajalla on ylin ja valvomaton valta maan asevoimiin, oikeuslaitokseen, valtiolliseen mediaan sekä keskeisiin poliittisiin instituutioihin. Hänellä on ratkaiseva vaikutus siihen, ketkä ylipäätään voivat asettua ehdolle vaaleissa, eikä hän ole vastuussa kansalle demokraattisten mekanismien kautta.

Vaikka Iranissa on muodollisesti presidentti ja parlamentti, näiden toimivalta on tiukasti rajattu. Ilman tätä kontekstia lukijalle voi syntyä virheellinen käsitys Iranin poliittisesta järjestelmästä ja vallankäytön todellisesta luonteesta.

Tällä sanavalinnalla on erityistä merkitystä nyt, kun Iranissa on käynnissä laajoja mielenosoituksia ja turvallisuusjoukkojen toiminnan seurauksena tuhansien ihmisten kerrotaan kuolleen tai joutuneen pidätetyiksi. Vallankäytön pehmentäminen kielellisesti voi tahattomasti vähätellä tilanteen vakavuutta.

Ylellä on tärkeä rooli luotettavana uutismediana, ja toivon, että artikkelin sanamuotoa harkitaan tältä osin uudelleen tai sitä täsmennetään, jotta yleisö saa mahdollisimman oikean kuvan Iranin todellisuudesta.

Kiitos ajastanne ja huomiostanne.
